# Discord (Skull) Reaction Bot
This is a simple Discord bot written in Python using the `discord.py` library. It automatically reacts with a skull emoticon to every new message posted in a specified channel.

After setting `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` and specifying channel and emoticon in `reaction_bot.py`, run with `python3 reaction_bot.py`.

# Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Discord account

# Disclaimer
- Don't be a nuisance
- Don't store your token in plaintext (in `reaction_bot.py`), store it in a `.env`. More instructions are commented in `reaction_bot.py`.
